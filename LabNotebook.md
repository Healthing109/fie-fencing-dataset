# LabNotebook

Inspired by Abhishek Gupta's talk on Lab Notebooks at [csv,conf,v6](https://csvconf.com/) (slides [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4737535#.YJGjZn1KhN0)), I have decided to maintain a labnotebook as part of this project to track more detailed, unfiltered notes. The aim of this notebook is not to be a polished presentation of the final product, but a history of its development including half-baked ideas and failed experiments.
